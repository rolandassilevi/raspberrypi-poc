# Avertissement Git à l'exécution de la commande *git add .*
Avertissement Git concernant les fins de ligne *(EOL – End Of Line)* entre les formats Unix et Windows.

## Explication
```bash
* LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it

```

Cela signifie que :

Les fichiers ajoutés à Git utilisent actuellement la fin de ligne *LF (Line Feed)*, utilisée sous Linux/macOS.
Etant sous Windows, Git va convertir automatiquement ces fins de ligne en *CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)* lors du prochain traitement (checkout, commit, etc.).

## Contexte technique :
*LF* : utilisé sur Linux/macOS
*CRLF* : utilisé sur Windows
Git peut être configuré pour gérer automatiquement ces conversions via le paramètre *core.autocrlf*

## Correction de l'avertissement

- Option 1 – Ne rien faire (si tu es en local sous Windows) :
Ces avertissements ne sont pas bloquants. Git gérera ça tout seul si *core.autocrlf* est bien configuré.

- Option 2 – Configurer Git pour ne pas avoir ces avertissements :

```bash
# Pour convertir automatiquement LF <-> CRLF selon l'OS
git config --global core.autocrlf true

```
*true* : Convertit *LF* en *CRLF* lors du checkout sur Windows, et inversement au commit.

*input* : Convertit uniquement lors du commit (utile si tu veux garder les fins de ligne Unix).

*false* : Ne fait rien, pas de conversion.

- Option 3 – Nettoyer les fins de lignes dans le dépôt (avancé) :

Ajouter un fichier *.gitattributes* à la racine du dépôt pour forcer Git à respecter un format :
```bash
*.py text eol=lf

```
Cela forcera les *.py* à rester en *LF*.

- A éviter
Ne jamais inclure le dossier *Lib/site-packages/* de ton environnement virtuel dans Git.

Il contient des milliers de fichiers binaires ou temporaires, inutiles au dépôt.

Ajoute ce dossier dans ton *.gitignore* :

```bash
.rpi-poc/Lib/

```
